# Introduction to Actions

Using data retrieved from Holaplex API endpoint we are able to construct transactions to perform actions weâ€™re interested in. Metaplex Foundation Programs power Holaplex marketplaces, but ultimately the data can be used in conjunction with any on-chain Program; open source or bespoke. 

### Metaplex Foundation Auction House

```
AuctionHouse is a protocol for marketplaces to implement a decentralized sales contract. It is simple, fast and very cheap. 

AuctionHouse is a Solana program available on Mainnet Beta and Devnet. Anyone can create an AuctionHouse and accept any SPL token they wish.
```
